## IAM Access Analyzer 
```md
IAM Access Analyzer

IAM Access Analyzer simplifies inspecting unused access to guide you toward least privilege. 

Security teams can use IAM Access Analyzer to gain visibility into unused access across their AWS organization and automate how they rightsize permissions.

When the unused access analyzer is enabled, IAM Access Analyzer continuously analyzes your accounts to identify unused access and creates a centralized dashboard with findings. 


The findings highlight unused roles, unused access keys for IAM users, and unused passwords for IAM users. 


For active IAM roles and users, the findings provide visibility into unused services and actions
